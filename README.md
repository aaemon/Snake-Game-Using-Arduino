# Snake Game Using Arduino

You just need to connet the wires as given in the code. The components used - Arduino Mega - 2560 (others can be used), 8 * 8 dot matrix module (MAX - 7219CNG), a keypad, and huge chunks of wires :P.
The code is provided and can ask me any questions if help needed. I will attach a video that it is working.
